### Board layout:

)


### Implemented rules
- Pawns will automatically become Queens when reaching the end of the board opposite of their starting position.
- Black starts (for now)
- No en passant
- No counting of move repetition (for now)
- No castling (Todo!)
- No checkmate (Todo!)


### Future ideas
- Implement server - client for online multiplayer
- Outsource constants, start player etc. to config file and make it changeable at runtime
- Implement timer (incl increment)
- More pieces / colors to chose from
- Bo3 etc.
- Turn board so that each client sees himself on bottom
